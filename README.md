# Lexer Parser in C++
This is my implementation of a lexer and parser function in C++, the lexer is a tokenizer and the parser implements the Shunting Yard Algorithm to retrive the formula in postfix notation.

### NOTE
This is part of the [Moodle_C](https://github.com/Uriegas/Moodle_C-) repo.

# TODO
Implement the evalute() function.

## BUILD
Run the [testing.sh](testing.sh) for build the project, implementing CMake.
