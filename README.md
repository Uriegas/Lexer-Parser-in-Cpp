# Lexer Parser in C++
This is my implementation of a lexer and parser function in C++, the lexer is a tokenizer and the parser implements the Shunting Yard Algorithm to retrive the formula in postfix notation.

### NOTE
This is part of the [Moodle_C](https://github.com/Uriegas/Moodle_C-) repo.

# TODO
* Implement the evalute() function.
* Implement the evaluate_negative_sign() function
```c++
    std::string evaluate_negative_sign(){}
```
This lexer does not support negative sign yet

## BUILD
Run the [testing.sh](testing.sh) for build the project, implementing CMake.
